lavalamp.js
===========

A replacement for infinite scroll. Works both ways (next and previous).

## Demo

[![LavaLamp screenshot](https://raw.github.com/jgthms/lavalamp.js/master/lavalamp.gif)](http://jgthms.com/lavalamp.js/lavalamp.html)

## HTML structure

* `a.button#lavalamp-previous` = `Load previous`
* your page content
* `a.button#lavalamp-next` = `Load next`
* `a#lavalamp` including a `span` = `Loading`

## Usage

After adding both `lavalamp.css` and `lavalamp.js` to your project, you can now use Lavalamp.

First you declare an instance of Lavalamp and assign it to a variable:

```
var lavalamp = new Lavalamp();

```

This now gives you access to 2 prototype functions `start()` and `stop()`;


`start()` accepts one argument, the direction of the animation i.e. either `up` or `down`.

`stop()` doesn't accept any arguments, it simply ends the animation in the direciton that you specified in `start()`.

By **default** `start()` is already fired when the `#lavalamp-previous` and `#lavalamp-next` buttons are clicked. After this event you would only then need to find the sufficient place to end the animation e.g. after an AJAX request.

For example:

```
var lavalamp = new Lavalamp();

$.getJSON('/someurl').done(function() {
  lavalamp.stop();
});
```

## How it works

There are 2 buttons: `#lavalamp-previous` and `#lavalamp-next`, that encapsulate the page.

When either of them is clicked, the `#lavalamp` HTML element covers the whole viewport while both the **content** of the page and the **scroll position** are updated.

Because all 3 elements look the same, it looks like the button clicked is **expanding** to cover the page.

For example, if you click *next*:

* the `lavalamp` is displayed, and initially positioned on top of the `next` button
* the `lavalamp`'s `bottom` and `height` properties are animated through CSS to cover the whole page
* scrolling is temporarily disabled
* the page scrolls to the top
* when the new content is loaded, the `lavalamp` is animated upwards to match the `previous` button
* the `lavalamp` is hidden and reset, scrolling is re-enabled

## Additional details

* For the sake of the **demo**, I use a `setTimeout` to simulate an Ajax call (the content remains unchanged).
* I also use a timeout after the last animation. I *could* use to detect CSS animation ends, but a timeout provides more flexibility, and prevents having to deal with browser inconsistencies. Plus, it's only 1 line.
* The `previous` button is the first child, the `next` button is the last child. It's *possible* to have other elements before and/or after, but then the illusion of the clicked button expanding is harder to execute because the `lavalamp` needs to be positioned *exactly* on the clicked button (which in the case, would not be exactly at `top: 0;` or `bottom: 0;`). It's possible to change the CSS animation values if needed though.
* The viewport is the whole `body`. It's possible to have a fixed **header** and/or **footer** as well, because the `lavalamp` is fixed as well. So, if you have a header that's `70px` high, just change the CSS animation's `top` values to be `70px`, not `0`; (GIF demo coming soon).

## Is this production-ready?

Kind of. The CSS animations should work well. The JS only takes care of updating the CSS classes, showing/hiding the lavalamp, and scrolling up and down. But it can be improved.

This repo is just a demo to showcase the intended user experience. Feel free to implement as you wish.
